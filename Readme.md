# RN487x

Arduino library for using the Microchip RN487x BLE module.

Updated to work with chipKIT boards.

## Usage

Quick example:

```c
#include "RN487x_BLE.h"

#define bleSerial Serial1
#define BT_RESET             7
#define BLUETOOTH_WAKE      12

void setup()
{
  rn487xBle.hwInit(BT_RESET, BLUETOOTH_WAKE);
  bleSerial.begin(rn487xBle.getDefaultBaudRate());
  rn487xBle.initBleStream(&bleSerial);
  if (rn487xBle.swInit())
  {
    rn487xBle.enterCommandMode();
    rn487xBle.stopAdvertising();
    rn487xBle.setAdvPower(3);
    rn487xBle.setSerializedName("Microchip");
    rn487xBle.clearAllServices();
    rn487xBle.reboot();
  }
}

void loop()
{
}

```


## Contributing


## History

v1.0.0 Initial Release

v1.1.0 Release
* enterCommandMode() now properly handles situation where module has prompt turned on or off
* Library now keeps track of if it is in command mode or not
* Added function setOperationMode()
* Added startCustomAdvertising() function
* Added support for PIC32 (chipKIT)
* Moved reset and wake pin definitions into hwInit() so that different boards can be supported without editing library

v1.2.0 Release
* Examples updated to work properly with chipKIT boards (like Fubarino Mini and RGB Station)
